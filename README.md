# Movie Store MVC Project
The Movie Store MVC Project is a web application that allows users to browse and rent movies from a movie store. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate the concerns of data storage, user interface, and business logic.

# Features
User Registration: Users can create an account to access the movie store.

Movie Catalog: Users can browse the available movies in the store, view details such as title, genre, and description, and search for movies based on various criteria.

User Management: Admin users have additional privileges to manage the movie catalog, including adding new movies, updating movie details, and removing movies from the store.
